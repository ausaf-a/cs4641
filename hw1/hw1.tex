\begin{itemize}
    \item No unapproved extension of the deadline is allowed. Late submission will lead to 0 credit.
    \item Discussion is encouraged, but each student must write their own answers and explicitly mention any collaborators.
    \item \color{red}Plagiarism is a \textbf{serious offense}. You are responsible for completing your own work. You are not allowed to copy and paste, or paraphrase, or submit materials created or published by others, as if you created the materials. All materials submitted must be your own.\color{black}
    \item \color{red}All incidents of suspected dishonesty, plagiarism, or violations of the Georgia Tech Honor Code will be subject to the instituteâ€™s Academic Integrity procedures. If we observe any (even small) similarities/plagiarisms detected by Gradescope or our TAs, \textbf{WE WILL DIRECTLY REPORT ALL CASES TO OSI}, which may, unfortunately, lead to a very harsh outcome. \textbf{Consequences can be severe, e.g., academic probation or dismissal, grade penalties, a 0 grade for assignments concerned, and prohibition from withdrawing from the class}.
\end{itemize}
\section*{Instructions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This assignment has no programming, only written questions.
    \item We will be using Gradescope for submission and grading of assignments. 
    \item Unless a question explicitly states that no work is required to be shown, you must provide an explanation, justification, or calculation for your answer.
    \item Your write up must be submitted in PDF form, you may use either Latex,  markdown, or any word processing software. \color{red}We will \textbf{NOT} accept handwritten work. \color{black}Make sure that your work is formatted correctly, for example submit $\sum_{i=0} x_i$ instead of \text{sum\_\{i=0\} x\_i}. A useful guide on LaTeX is provided in \href{https://edstem.org/us/courses/16925/discussion/995658}{this Edstem post}.
    \item Please answer each question on a new page. It makes it more organized to map your answers on GradeScope. When submitting your assignment, you must correctly map pages of your PDF to each question/subquestion to reflect where they appear. Improperly mapped questions may not be graded correctly.
    \item Discussion is encouraged on Edstem as part of the Q/A. You may discuss high-level ideas with other students at the "whiteboard" level (e.g. how cross validation works, using matmul instead of dot) and review any relevant materials online. However, all assignments should be done individually, each student must write up and submit their own answers.
    \item \textbf{Graduate Students}: You are required to complete any sections marked as Bonus for Undergrads

\section{Covariance, Correlation, and Independence [5pts + 4pts]}
\subsection{Covariance [5pts]}
Suppose $X, Y$ and $Z$ are three different random variables.
Let $X$ obey a Bernoulli Distribution. The probability distribution function is
    $$p(x)=\left\{
    \begin{array}{c l}	
         0.5 & x = c\\
         0.5 & x = -c.
    \end{array}\right.$$
$c$ is a constant here. Let $Y$ obey the Standard Normal (Gaussian) Distribution, which can be written as $Y \sim N(0,1)$. $X$ and $Y$ are independent. Meanwhile, let $Z = XY$.
\newline

Calculate the covariance of Y and Z ($Cov(Y, Z)$) and determine whether values of c would affect the correlation.\bigskip \\

\section{Optimization [15pts]}
Optimization problems are related to minimizing a function (usually termed loss, cost or error function) or maximizing a function (such as the likelihood) with respect to some variable x. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are first-order conditions for a solution in nonlinear programming to be optimal, provided that some regularity conditions are satisfied. In this question, you will be solving the following optimization problem:
\begin{align*}
    \min_{x,y} \;\;& f(x,y) = 7x^{2} + 4y \\
    \text{s.t.} \;\;& g_{1}(x,y) = x^{2}+y^{2}\leq 2 \\
    & g_{2}(x,y) = x \leq 1
\end{align*}

\section{Maximum Likelihood [10pts + 15pts Bonus for Undergrads]}
\subsection{Discrete Example [10pts]}
Devshree and Angana are arguing over where they should go for winter break. Devshreeâ€™s argument is that they should go to Boston because Megha, their childhood friend, lives there and thus they will get to have a good time. Anganaâ€™s argument is that they should go to Florida because Florida is very near to Atlanta, it has the mildest winter and on the other hand, Bostonâ€™s weather is very rough during the winter.\\\\To resolve this conflict, their other friend Yusuf makes a proposition that they should leave it to chance to decide where they should spend their winter break. Devshree then proposes that Angana will toss a 6-sided die 10 times, and Angana must get anything except 2 during the first 9 times and must get 2 during the 10th time. Any other combination will make Devshree the winner. But Angana is also allowed to tamper with the die in any manner she likes to increase her odds.\\\\Now, Angana needs you to help her have her way. If the probability of getting a 2 is $\theta$ and the probabilities of landing on any other number is the same, what value of $\theta$ is most likely to ensure that they will have to go to Florida? Use your expertise of Maximum Likelihood Estimation and probability distribution function to convince Angana.\\\\\textbf{NOTE: }You may assume that the log-likelihood function is concave for this question\bigskip \\
